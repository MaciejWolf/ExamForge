# Plan.md Format Rules

This document defines the format and conventions for `plan.md` files used in task planning.

## Basic Structure

Keep it minimal and focused:

```md
# Feature: reporting

Goal:
Short summary of what this feature should achieve.

Tasks:
- [ ] data-upload
- [ ] report-view
- [ ] export
```

## Subtask Plans

Subtasks can have their own `plan.md` in subdirectories:

```md
# data-upload

Goal:
Short summary of what data-upload should do.

Tasks:
- [ ] backend-endpoint
- [ ] ui-uploader
- [ ] basic-validation
```

## Optional Sections

Add these sections when useful (not required by default):

* `Context:` – links, quick notes, background information
* `Open questions:` – uncertainties that need to be resolved
* `Risks:` – potential issues or blockers
* `Dependencies:` – other tasks or external dependencies

## Detailed Task Files

Leaf tasks that need more detail can get their own `.md` file, linked like:

```md
Tasks:
- [ ] [validate-file-format](./validate-file-format.md)
```

## Task Status

* Tasks are tracked with markdown checkboxes: `- [ ]` for incomplete, `- [x]` for complete
* Parent tasks can link to sub-plans:

  ```md
  - [ ] [data-upload](./data-upload/plan.md)
  ```

* Plain leaf tasks:

  ```md
  - [ ] handle-empty-files
  ```

## Principles

* **Start shallow**: Don't expand deeply upfront—only add detail where needed
* **Stay flexible**: Plans should be easy to modify as understanding evolves
* **Be concise**: Keep descriptions short and actionable
* **Use clear names**: Task names should be descriptive and use `kebab-case`
