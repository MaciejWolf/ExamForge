# Page Name
*Provide a concise, one-sentence summary of the page's primary purpose.*

## Navigation
*List all possible navigation paths **from** this page. For each path, specify the user action that triggers it (e.g., clicking a button, a link) and the destination page.*

## Layout
*Describe the overall layout structure of the page (e.g., two-column, grid-based). List the main UI components and their arrangement.*

### Wireframe
*Create an ASCII art representation of the page's layout. This should visually depict the placement of the main components. If the page includes unique pop-ups or modals, represent them separately below the main wireframe.*

### Component Descriptions
*Provide a detailed list of the components mentioned in the Layout section. For each component, describe its purpose, behavior, and any relevant states (e.g., disabled, active).*

## Other Information
*This section is for any additional information not covered above. This may include user interaction flows, specific business rules, permissions, edge cases, or other functional and non-functional requirements.*
