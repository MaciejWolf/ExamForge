This document provides best practices for authoring React components in this codebase.

**Component Basics**
- Always use arrow functions for components.
- Type component props explicitly using TypeScript.

```typescript
type Props = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

export const MyComponent = (props: Props) => {
  // component implementation
};
```

**Styling**
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
- Prefer Shadcn UI components when available for consistency and accessibility.

**Data Fetching**
- Use React Query for all asynchronous API calls and caching.
- Encapsulate network requests in custom hooks when possible.

**State Management**
- Use Zustand for global or shared local state management.
- Co-locate component-specific state with the component (React useState, useReducer) if it is not shared.

**Shadcn**
- Before starting implementation, determine which shadcn components will be used. Install them if needed.

**General Guidelines**
- Organize code for clarity and reusability.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Write components that are as stateless and presentational as possible, separating logic/data-fetching into hooks.

Refer to project examples for preferred folder structure and naming conventions.
Prefer vertical slices/feature folders
