- When defining data structures, prefer `type` to `interface`
- Avoid using `any`. Prefer generics and discriminated unions instead.
- Prefer rich typing in functional programming manner
- Prefer arrow functions over `function` keyword or classes.
- Don't write comments, unless they refer to something really complicated. Treat reader as an experienced senior developer.
